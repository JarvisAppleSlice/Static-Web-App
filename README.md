# CSWD-Code-Along

Static Web Application
Overview:

This project was developed as part of a guided learning exercise, following instructional examples while actively implementing, testing, and debugging each feature to reinforce core front-end development concepts.
This project is a static web application developed to further practice client-side web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It builds on the same foundational ideas as the personal portfolio while reinforcing consistency, interactivity, and structured front-end logic.
The application focuses on applying learned concepts through repetition and refinement.

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Concepts Demonstrated:

Structured HTML layout and styling with CSS
JavaScript-based interactivity
Dynamic visibility of page elements
Form handling and user input processing
Local storage and cookie usage for simple persistence
Debugging and incremental feature development

How to Run:

Clone the repository
Open index.html in a web browser
Use the interactive elements to explore functionality

Lessons Learned:

Reinforced core front-end development concepts
Improved confidence with JavaScript logic and state handling
Practiced debugging UI behavior across features
Strengthened understanding of browser-based storage

Future Improvements:

Reduce duplicated logic through refactoring
Improve UI consistency and responsiveness
Add comments and documentation for maintainability
Explore light framework usage for comparison
